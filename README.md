### Talk Format - 20 Minutes (+ Questions)

We follow the "success formula" from the Vienna.js meetup and try to keep talks to about 20 minutes each - shorter always possible ;-).
You're also welcome to split your talk in two parts (or even three) and present your talk as "episodes" at two or three 
following meetups as an ongoing series.
